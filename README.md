# image-translator

The goal of this program is to translate images across different formats (ppm, p3, p6, pz). This project was developped in the context of CMSC 152 at UChicago, using C. Some of the image formats were made up for the purpose of this exercice (see more about this in PZ-file-format.txt, which was given for this project)
